# Implementation Plan: Local Runtime and Model Lab

**GitHub:** [#13](https://github.com/edithatogo/rcagent/issues/13)

Execution follows [workflow.md](../../workflow.md) and the
[continuous autonomy contract](../../autonomy.md).

## Continuous Execution Contract

- Continue automatically through tasks, phase checkpoints, fresh-context
  review, bounded rework, documentation synchronization, and the next ready
  track.
- Do not ask for routine approval at task, phase, review, or track boundaries.
- If a decision gate is reached, pause only the affected scope, release its
  lane, continue safe independent work, and present options with a
  recommendation, rationale, evidence, trade-offs, reversibility, safe
  default, and dependency impact.
- Use bounded retry, autonomous plan repair, durable resume state, stale-lock
  recovery, and safety circuit breakers from `autonomy.md`.

## Phase 0: Existing-System Fit and Gap Closure

- [ ] Task: Establish the system and dependency context
  - [ ] Read `integration-strategy.md` and this track's entry in `integration-map.json`
  - [ ] Identify the current organisational system, standard, framework, runtime, or platform that already owns each capability
  - [ ] Record exact versions, extension points, licences, maintenance, privacy, telemetry, offline, device, and security constraints
  - [ ] Test existing configuration, profiles, APIs, exports, imports, plugins, and adapters against representative fixtures
