# Implementation Plan: NSW Health Jurisdiction Pack

**GitHub:** [#9](https://github.com/edithatogo/rcagent/issues/9)

Execution follows [workflow.md](../../workflow.md) and the
[continuous autonomy contract](../../autonomy.md).

## Continuous Execution Contract

- Continue automatically through tasks, phase checkpoints, fresh-context
  review, bounded rework, documentation synchronization, and the next ready
  track.
- Do not ask for routine approval at task, phase, review, or track boundaries.
- If a decision gate is reached, pause only the affected scope, release its
  lane, continue safe independent work, and present options with a
  recommendation, rationale, evidence, trade-offs, reversibility, safe
  default, and dependency impact.
- Use bounded retry, autonomous plan repair, durable resume state, stale-lock
  recovery, and safety circuit breakers from `autonomy.md`.

## Phase 0: Existing-System Fit and Gap Closure

- [ ] Task: Establish the system and dependency context
  - [ ] Read `integration-strategy.md` and this track's entry in `integration-map.json`
  - [ ] Identify the current organisational system, standard, framework, runtime, or platform that already owns each capability
  - [ ] Record exact versions, extension points, licences, maintenance, privacy, telemetry, offline, device, and security constraints
  - [ ] Test existing configuration, profiles, APIs, exports, imports, plugins, and adapters against representative fixtures

- [ ] Task: Select the smallest adequate intervention
  - [ ] Prefer existing-system configuration or a standards profile
  - [ ] Prefer a thin replaceable adapter when translation is the remaining gap
  - [ ] Identify generic gaps suitable for an authorised upstream issue or contribution
  - [ ] Limit project code to the smallest safety-, privacy-, jurisdiction-, or domain-specific extension
  - [ ] Require a fit-gap record and approved ADR before any new subsystem or permanent fork

- [ ] Task: Define the dependency lifecycle
  - [ ] Assign each dependency to a locked core, optional adapter, enterprise connector, evaluation, or experimental profile
  - [ ] Define contract tests, compatibility windows, drift checks, failure isolation, and safe fallback
  - [ ] Give every local shim an upstream reference, owner, expiry or removal condition, and replacement path
  - [ ] Update `integration-map.json` with the selected status and evidence links

- [ ] Task: Phase Verification & Checkpoint
  - [ ] Verify that no planned work duplicates an adequate existing capability
  - [ ] Verify the system-of-record and data-authority boundary
  - [ ] Verify the smallest remaining gap and ownership rationale
  - [ ] Record the fit-gap receipt and bounded handoff context
  - [ ] Continue automatically through the next ready phase, review, bounded rework, documentation synchronization, and next ready track
  - [ ] If an owner gate is reached, create a complete decision packet, pause only the affected scope, release the lane, and continue independent work
